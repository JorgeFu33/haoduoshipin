titile: How To Add A User On Ubuntu
---

On ubuntu, it is recommanded to do everything under a common user rather than the root user, yes even for administration tasks. This video will show you how to create a common user and give it superuser power, so that you can use this user to run commands that only root user has the permissions to run.

## Command

The command is simple.

```
adduser billie --ingroup sudo
``` 

you will see the err:

```
adduser: Only root may add a user or group to the system.
```

this fix is adding sudo before the command

```
sudo adduser billie --ingroup sudo
```

now you need to type in password for the user `billie`, other infomation is optional, type Enter to skip them.


run 

```
su billie
cd 
```

to go to the HOME directory of billie, and we are good to go.


## Switch from root to new user

if you want to become root user

```
sudo su
```

Cmd-D to quit root and back to user billie

or you can use

```
su peter
```

to become peter. So that's how you switch from different users.


## Know More

```
man adduser
```

then you type `/` and search `--ingroup` to know more about this option.

BTW, you can use

```
man userdel
```

to find out how you can delete a user.

## End

That's the simple trick I want to share today, plz remember, you use `adduser` to create a new user.
