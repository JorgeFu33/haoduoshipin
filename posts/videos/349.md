## Why this Report?

I always consider myself a tool for the community. By community I mean Open Source community, I got started in Linux community to learn coding a decade ago, and hold a passion for the community since then. Now I do full time writing on Blockchain, and believe the victory of Blockchain is the victory of Open Source and the community. So I am willing to open as many my work details as possible, and try my best to serve the community.
