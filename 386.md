title: Why Reading Matters for English Learners?
---

No grammer, No IPA, but how Americans learn English? In the eariler video, I talked about how America kids use Phonics to achieve literacy, when I said the American way is almost the oppisite of how we are teaching our kids in China. But the key difference will only be shown, in this episode in which we talk about leveled reading. The key takeaways here is American schools focus on developing the passion for reading, rather than rote memorization. Plz note, below is mostly how I borrow the idea of leveled reading in America edu system and tailored to my own needs, so a lot of things that I do can be largely different from mainstream reality.

There are three Problems I want to address here? How to choose content, how to build up vocabulary, and how to build the passion for reading?

## Choosing Content

Firstly how to choose the right content to read? 

I should mention it's the level rather then the grade that matters. In china, if the kid failed the exam and has to stay in the same grade for another year, that is a big deal. While in US, teachers care more about your reading levels then the score. if a kids failed to go to next level of reading, teachers will provide special help. they have clear requirement which level a kid shoud be at, given certain age. A common scene in America classrooms is a lot of baskets each containes books of one certain level. there are many different ways to set levels of books, such as The Lexile Framework, say, if kid finish around 1 million words, she is likely ready to move to next levels. In reality I don't follow this method, but the general idea is right. Extensive reading is everything. Quantity matters.

Make sure to start where you are. From my observation, most Chinese students failed their english because they are learning material's are too difficult. But how to define easy? seemingly simple question that is very controvertial in reality. Many believe real life English is too difficult to start, cause in real conversations, people try to be houmous and concise, words can be used in tricky ways, sentences are often not accord to grammer rules. But come on, this is just how native speaking kids learn how to speak. In my definition being easy simply means it is common in your life. Things you learn first are not the simple ones but the ones people around you are using most often, and in multiple ways, our brain love repitition as we all know. So, as long as the content is comprehensable to me or my kid Elon, it is good content. And only yourself knows hat is really comprehensable and easy for you, so don't let others in charge of the choosing of your learning contetn.

There is the thing called 5 finger rule. Open a page of a book, once you encounter a new word, you raise a finger, at the end, if you raise 5 or more fingers, that means the book is too challenging for you. 4 is still very chanllenging, 2-3 is just right, and 0-1 is too easy.

It is also important to narrow your interests. Focus on a few areas you are mostly interested. I will suggest you think to problems, for myself, what bothers me is that I often struggle with family life communication, and I want Elon to pay more attention to science and technology. I believe having clear goals helps you advace faster, since you are more likely to repeat some content if you scope is smaller.

What differs from my strategy with the one the schools' been using is that I use way more videos. Yeah, I know the benifits of books, being, less noisy, more room for imagination, less hormone stimulation. But I prefer more videos, well selected ones of course. Videos can be more entertaining that helps you to focus and sustain. Some highly logical and complex things are easier to learn in videos. And in my family's case, we need to do more shadow reading to practice pronouciations. And for my kid Elon, I believe it's better to build up the oral vocabulary before he can even read. He is now 4.5 years old, many of his classmates can read and even write lots of chinese charaters. But I am in no hurry, everyday we use 20 mins to draw something, letters are often a subject to draw, but I don't consider that's writing, I think I will keep it this way for next one or two years for him. reading ablities will only start to be paid serious attention after Elon speaks very well, taking the route of  most native speaking kids. I've heard Finland shcools do not teach kids how to read until 7 years old. So videos are just right for Elon and me.

So yes, that's how we choose right content for us.

## Vocabulary
Let's move on to vocabulary builing. Yeah, I am convinced that the right way to learn new words is through extensive reading. not vocabulary book or dictionaries. The key here is bing a new work to the actual thing, not the decriptioin like in a vocabulary book or dictionaries. Even the decription is in English, I still consider that harmful, and If you use Chinese, I am convinced that your English learning is doomed.

Recently I've checked a few videos on The Natrual Approach, which is a method to learn your second language. In a classroom following this method, there are 3 very interesting rules. NO.1 No mother tongue. For me, it means I don't speak Chinese at home. NO.2 No grammer. Research has shown that trying too hard to learn grammer bring huge obstacle when you try to speak fluently. NO.3 No correction, anybody make lots of mistake when they are speaking, and there will be a lot of things they don't understand while listening, but the natual approach encourage you to just keep going. Correctioin works, but just for a while, you tent to forget it soon. Mostly does not worth the time.

Now I am convinced that learning with vocabulary books is fatal mistake. By connecting a english written word, to some Chinese charaters, you set yourself to the trap that you can never really speak English, no matter how smart you are and how hard you try. That's simply how our brain works. If you want to speak fluntly, it is best to connect the sound of a word directly to the thing you try to say. If reading speed is top of your priority, argubly it's best to connect the shape of a word, not whole spelling, just the shape to the thing yo try to understand. The way most american kids were tought is to put speaking on top, so most of the words are learnt by connecting sound to the thing. Then they use Phonics to translate sound to written word. This feels right to me, because it is when speaking that we need our brain to react fast, not so much when writing. Now pause and think of why speaking English is so hard for most Chinese people, everytime we try to say a word, we are burdened by a long chain from sound of English word to some chinese then to the actual thing. If you are trying to translte while you are speaking, you can not speak, if you think of the grammers before you speak, you can not speak. This is just simple and undeniable fact. BTW, some people suggest roting phrases is better than roting words, but to me, it does not work either, even this gives the word certain context, which is absolutely a better idea, but you are still connecting English to your mother tongue. So what is the right way? Forget your own language, just learn like a baby, all in English from day 1. Seemingly hard, but it is not. Watching cartoons, reading picture books, connecting the sound to the dame thing, this is just any baby can do, so does a adult.  
                                    

Yeah, I think I will just follow the natural apporach, reading a lot, speaking and watching a lot. But one question arise here, are they suggesting extensive reading only? We've taught that it's better to combine extensive and intensive reading. The answer is clear. If intensive reading means you slow down, working on sth that is more difficult and thus you need to repeat many times to understand, I think the anwser is NO. You dont need intensive reading, to learn grammers, syntaxes, and vocabularies. I don't deny repetation in some cases are needed, but out of my own experience, too often, I wasted a tons of time repeating the content, simply because the textbook were too difficult for me. I could have learnt it with 10 persent of the time, if the course was designed properly. Now I don't think you have to slowing down in order to learn grammers or Phonics rules. In my current study, grammers and phonics rules will be highlighted by some dedicated Khan Kids lessons. you know what, I also take a extensive reading approach to learn these lessons, meaning I do not force myself to remember anything, just try to understand. For more,  I also love the super elaborated tiny english lessons by some Youtube channels, say, Reachel's English, Bob the Canadian Guy, Learn English with Vernasa and so on. Again, I browse them, never repeat, never bookmark, never note taking. Pronoucation are practiced when I do shadowing and singing everyday with Elon. The natural approach beleive grammer, phonics, words, expressions these things can not be learnt. you can only acquire them subconciously, after enough proper leveled reading, enough comprehnsive input, everything will natually fall into its place. so the conculsion is good news, you can avoid the boring intensive reading completely.

Enlarging your vocabulary is a gradual process of getting a sense of what the scope of meaning of the word is as I see it in different contexts. getting familiar with the word, at some point it starts to click in.

## Passion

The key to a successful education is cultivating motivatioin. If your kids are not interested in reading, anything else is just meaningless.

I am just not too crazy about main stream leveled reading series, say RAZ or Oxford Reading Tree. They just give me a old-school feeling and most of the stories are not that exciting. I know, one of the design goals of these books are to teach you daily conversation, so being exciting is not necessarily the goal. But for me, if I want some fun, I rather let Elon follow a cartoon seriers, say dragon ball, Aoraemon or Transformers. This way, he will develop a deep love for the main characters, and I still remeber I cried for some cartoons many times in my life. I don't care some story about some random boys and animals. And on the other hand, if I am in the mood for sth serious, I'd rather Elon to learn real skills like designing, math, phtography, yeah, solid stuff, rather than, some random historical stories. In my eariler video, you may know that we are of a project-based learning approah, so pragmatic skills or even science related illustrations are well suited material even during the stage when Elon is learning English language.

American schools follow the I PICK rule. which means students has freedom to choose what he wants to read. I – I choose a book. P – Purpose- Why do I want to read it? I – Interest- Does the book interest me? C – Comprehension- Am I understanding what I am reading? K – Know- Do I know most of the words? Even for textbook, the teacher only require students understand 70% before move on, this is hugely different from our education during which whole article memerization is required for many of the articles.

No kids want to be interrupted watching cartoons. Also from the natrual approach I've learned, as parents we tent to believe mistakes must be correct, otherwise they become constant. But in reaclity, wasting time on correcting and explaining does not worth the trouble. If your kid can not undertand a concept, it's highly likely he lacks a lot of the background knowledge, it is usually not something you can fix with a few minintes explaination. The best stretegy is probably don't pause, and just move on. The natural approach suggest that it is wise not try to hard to understand, 60% undertanding is good enough to move on. Repetetion makes reading boring, since our brain needs novelty to work best.

So in my own home, Our rutine is that Elon will do 2hr shandow reading, 2hr watching cartoon, 1hr singing, everyday. We choose videos and books we are most interested in. There is some comunication to share the fun watching, but I try to avoid explainatioin and correction, unless I feel it is really sth ergent.


## Conclusion

So to conculde, the way I described above is very different from what our schools are doing. There is almost no repetation, no expectation for full understanding, fast going, vast content quantity. content are chosen based on serving real life needs, rather than exam oriented. This is important, so that we learn the most common things first, not what is grammerly simple onces. perfection achieved by reapeatly seeing the words and grammers in real and different contexts, rather than remeber them with one lesson. All could be boiled down to one thing, learning like a baby.
