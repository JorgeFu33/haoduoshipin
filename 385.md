Phonics is a method of learning to read. Phonics works by breaking each word up into it’s individual sounds before blending those sounds back 
together to make the word.Children learn to 'decode' words by breaking it down into sounds rather than having to memorise 1,000's of words individually. Research has shown that phonics, when taught correctly, can be the most effective way of teaching children to learn to read. 

- my steps
  - use 3 years to hear 44 English sounds, have basic vacabulary and understanding
  - start to learn letter names and letter sounds
  - do phonics, connect the sounds
  - when baby can read some words, try to guide them read simple picture books(level 1)
  - you need enough reading before you get to level 2

- resources
  - use flash cards to learn simple meaning words
    - there is only so much you can learn with still imgs
    - most words still need to learn with cartoons/games/life etc.
  - Math learning
    - cartoon: MathBlocks
    - Khan
  - engineering
    - Bob the builder: https://www.ixigua.com/7067918044139356685
  - MUST HAVE: use khan kids to learn more abxstract ones, like 
    - Phonics
      - 'ay' sound was trained in grade2 course, surprise
      - libaray content are also categrized by different grades
        - check 'letters' and 'reading' to learn Phonics
          - you get 'sight words', show vowel, long vowels and everything
    - why app is better than pics and videos?
      - hints
        - every time you play with a word or letter?
          - you can see the img of the word, and you can hear the sound
          - no explaination needed
        - every time you spell a word correct, app will say it out
          - 'you spelled the word horse right'
          - this way, kids learn a very important concept which is 'spelling'
      - finger tracking read
        - App highlights the word being read
     - the app is designed to help kids learn Phonics while mastering logic and match, which is great
    - Elon Musk 'learning should be like gaming'
      - the games has its advatages that videos can never match
      - drawing more attention, bring the chanllege and thus fun
      - when you teach logic, u need interaction
        - videos won't do it, you need a teacher, or the App
      - make sure kid's understanding before moving on
      - anyway, way better than videos.
      - give a scitific path of learning, video courses are mostly short and targeting one subject
        - khan kids offers everything in a orgainzed way
    - first/last/long
    - oppisites
    - Adaptive Learning Path 
    - leveled books
    - signs--picture of words in daily life
      - this is for kids before phonics and reading
      - help you tell words from pictures
    - how are you feeling?
    - games to learn letters
      - more fun for kids for sure
  - leveled cartoons
    - level0: 
      - English Singsing: Very solid content, definitely a MUSH HAVE

- what before Phonics?
  - PA is sometimes taught separately from phonics and at other times it is the result of phonics instruction (i.e. segmenting or blending phonemes with letters)
  - 安妮鲜花 says: you don't need a large vocabulary to start Phonics, Phoni awareness is important. But her kids make great progress despite that when her kids started Phonics, they did not understand the teacher well. You don't even need to know the word CAT to start Phonics. But of course, when you choose teaching material, don't use these that has too many advanced words.
  - knowing the 44 sounds, can being able to tell the difference is Key


- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonics
  - Reading by using phonics is often referred to as decoding words,sounding-out words or using print-to-sound relationships.
  - Phonemic awareness (PA) is sometimes confused with Phonics, however, PA is the ability to hear, identify, and manipulate the individual spoken sounds — unrelated to their letters.
  -  PA is sometimes taught separately from phonics and at other times it is the result of phonics instruction (i.e. segmenting or blending phonemes with letters).[19][20][21]


- general terms, methodology, and steps here: https://www.readwithphonics.com/what-is-phonics

Children learn to 'decode' words by breaking it down into sounds rather than having to memorise 1,000's of words individually.


A letter is just a picture, and it has a sound and a name.
- before you learn Phonics, make sure, you are already a speaker
  - Phonics is the way to reading
  - for example, you already know speaking, you pick up a book
    - with Phonics learned, you can slowly start to read things


- then a skill you need to learn is to do sount counting(not letter counting)
  - how many sounds in the word xxx?
    - cat 3
      - 'c,a,t cat' is a very bad idea, you do '/k/,/a/,/t/' instead 
        - learning, not memorization
    - car 2
    - do this every day

# steps

Sounds are taught from easiest to hardest: starting with single letter sounds and then moving on to two letters making a sound and then three and so on. Learning phonics and learning to read is one of the most important stepping stones in early education as it gives your child the skills they need to move forward in every subject, you simply cannot progress without it.

The alphabet is a great place to start learning phonics as if you learn the simple 26 letter sounds of the alphabet you will be well on your way to learning all 44 sounds. Our alphabet phonics song is a good way to learn all of the alphabet letter sounds:

https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJ63I2qqtxQ 


- the US does not you bigraph/trigraph/split_graph, they use
  - A vowel is long when it says its own name. When a single vowel is at the end of a word or syllable, it usually makes the long vowel sound, as in ‘go’ and ‘paper’.

  - Silent ‘e’: When ‘e’ is the last letter in a word and there is only one other vowel in that word, the first vowel usually says its own alphabet name and the ‘e’ is silent, like in ‘cake’.

  - Consonant digraphs and blends: In a consonant digraph, two consonants work together to form one sound that isn’t like either of the letters it is made from. E.g. ship think

  - Consonant blends are groups of two or three consonants whose individual sounds can be heard as they blend together. E.g. clam scrub grasp.

- NewZealand's Whole Language Approach
  - Over the past decade, New Zealand’s educational system has favoured the whole language approach to reading. This teaches children to learn new words based on context: for example, by encouraging them to guess a word in the book they’re reading based on the story, pictures, or words around it. 

  - With a whole reading approach, children don’t learn to break down sounds individually, but to take words at face value and associate them with prior knowledge. If a child sees the word ‘dog’ written enough times with a picture of a dog he or she will then associate that word, in it’s entirety, with the idea of a dog.

- Jolly Phonics' five key skills
  - https://www.jollylearning.co.uk/jolly-phonics-4/
  - learning the letter sound
  - letter formation
  - blending
  - segmenting
  - tricky words

- 5 steps to Phonics
  - The Alphabet(Phonic Awareness)
  - short Vowels(Begining of Phonics)
    - the CVC rule
      - consonent vowel consonent
      - first you teach /a/, than /t/, then at 
        - now you add s, p, r, m, h, f, c, b in front
          - youtube-LucyMax has CVC courses for this part
      - second, you teach other word families
        - e.g en, et, ag ... then add a consonent in front 
      - e.g cat, pin
    - under the CVC rule, all 5 vewel letters has each own short sound
  - Long Vowels
    - the 'magic e' rule
      - pin is /pin/ but pine is totally different vowel sound
    - also five
      - A, E, I, O, U
      - the letter name is the letter sound in this case
  - consonant Blends
  - letter combinations

- you need to remeber all the 44 sounds
  - search '44 phonics sound'
  - one sound a time, add new sound gradually 
    - each sound need to be repeated many times to the kid
      - make sure kids know the 44 sounds seperately very well
      - don't blend sounds together, this is kinda important
  - two letters in two days, and then the third day review

- course design
  - K1(first year of day care) first 3 grounps and not to much writing
  - K2(4yearold) - all groups and word reading and writing
  - K3 - all groups and sentence reading and writing
  - Jolly Phonics https://www.jollyliteracy.com/home/jolly-phonics

- tricky words are used to be called sight words
  - learn them through reading lots of text
  - no need to remeber the spelling
    - side note: focusing on spelling is a HUGE mistake for chinese students, should first on understanding and then pronouncing, and last step is to remeber the spelling. Spending more time on vocabulary book, then on reading was the reason my english was bad.
    - for the words  following Phonics rules, you don't need to remember the spelling, for these does not, which are sight words, you still don't really need to try too hard on spelling, cause you use them every day. 
    - if kids make wrong spelling using Phonics rules, techers won't correct them. cause they will correct themsevlves when they learn the right spelling through reading laster on.
    - using Rhyming words to learn words by groups, e.g. where here there/get let pet met net. Songs and Poems are good place to find Rhyming words.
    - in 安妮鲜花's book, shen mentiioned how her daughter remember spelling in Cannada, that was from sound to spelling, not from sepelling to meaning as we do in Chnia. the meaning was not learnt when they try to remeber spelling, but reading.
    - rhyming words is also a good way to learn spelling, with lyrics of kid's songs.

- alternative methods to Phonics
  - Whole Lanaguage Approach (WLA)
    -  teaching children to use context cues to guess the meaning of a printed word
    - this meaning, you dont need to learn spelling before you can read
    - you read more, and you are more familary with the shape of words
    - it's guessing game
    - Phonics distract the reader from the meaning of the word, cause reader would focus on the sound, and then blend sounds to oral English, which is longer road before comprehension
    - seems to me, WLA believe every word should be a sight word, the less time you used on decode each word, the faster you read
    - During the 2000s, whole language receded to marginal status, and continues to fade. In 1996, the California Department of Education led the way in returning to the teaching of phonics. The National Reading Panel in the United States concluded that systematic phonics instruction is more effective than unsystematic phonics or non-phonics instruction.

- what after Phonics?
  - OxfordReadingTree
  - RAZ picture book
  - at least 1million words each year
  - I will use khan kids to level the content
- test is really important
  - knowing what to test, check the edu websites of US
  - test with games
  - test with interactive reading
  - document the progress

- grammer?
  - No grammer class
  - said and say, shop and shopped, are all spelling class, not grammer
