title: How Ameriacans Learn To Read
---

Hi am Peter. In this episode I want to introduce you how americans learn to read, I will compared with the way I , as a China student, learned english to make my point clear.  Note, I am by no means a expert on this topic, so don't expect exat details, but I believe the main idea here is very inspiring.

## What is Phonics?

I've found the way they use is called Phonics. They don't use IPA like we do in China.

So what is Phonics? Phonics is a method of learning how to read. Phonics works by breaking each word up into it’s individual sounds before blending those sounds back together to make the word. Children learn to 'decode' words by breaking it down into sounds rather than having to memorise 1,000's of words individually. Research has shown that phonics, when taught correctly, can be the most effective way of teaching children to learn to read. 

So how it works? First thing kids need to learn is letters. The 26 English letters each has its own name and sound. For example, The name of letter A is A, however the sound of it is /a/ . Since American kids already know how to pronounce a lot of words, so it is not that hard to learn the letter sound, just tell them /a/ as you say in the word Apple or Alligator. There are 44 sounds with Enlgish totally. Can you use some letter or letter combinaton to resemble all of them? The answer is of course. Even though some letters has more than one sound, some different letters or letter combinations share same sound. It's not a perfect system, like IPA, when you invent the notes to give a 1-to-1 map to each sound. 

But hey, the Phonics way brings a lot of benifits. Both IPA and Phonics are like PinYin in Chinese. If you are learning Chinese, even you know the sound of a charater and the pinyin to make the sound, you still need to know how to write the charater on its own, that is to draw the litter picture. But things get simpler here in English, as long as you on how a word sounds, with Phonics rules, you can write down the real word. This simple truth making learning IPA kind of lame IMO, you needed to learn a bunch of lab invented things, and because you don't use that often, you tend to forget them, and even you learn them and you can speak the words, still you can not spell them, meaning more effort to remember the spelling.

There are some words does not follow the Phonics rule. They are tricky words, and called Sight Words. School needs you to remeber them seperately. Luckily the number of them is limited.

## Reading

But the real power of Phonics shows when kids pick up a book. 

The story could go like this. Now a kid speaks 1000 words, knows Phonics, and has learned 300 words learning Phonics. He picks up a book, when enountering a word they don't know how to read, he uses Phonics to pronounce it, and realize it is already in his oral vocabulary, so the reading continues. Otherwise, they still don't really need a dictionary, you may guess the meaning of it and continue. Later you use this word in your conversation, maybe your parents will correct you if you use the word in a wrong way.

A word about grammers. Simple answers is they don't really learn grammer. In early school years, they don't even have text books. time we spend to remeber these hard rules, they use to read a lot of books. In China, it seems as long as we know a lot of words, and a lot of grammer rules, we can just translate Chinese into English, this is tragically wrong. American kids also pick up rules along the way, but practicing is at the core, not the rules.

Reading is not just about language itself, if kids don't have logics or math knowledge, their reading ablility is limited. In real world, Phonics rules are not tought all at onces, they are scattered around from pre-K to 2nd grade in Khan Kids. The App provide you with leveled content to learn math and logic. In my own case, my kid Elon can not join a Phonics class, the App provides the interactions that helps kids to learn Phonics, logics and math quickly. This is not sth video tutorials can offer.

We can see Phonics is a bright between written and oral English. It is a powerful tool to learn how to read.


## Writing

Writing is too big a topic, here I mainly focus on how americans remember word spelling, which is also very different from what I did.

First of all, if you know how a word sounds, you can spell it. You may not be accurate, but certainly knowing Phonics meaning you know how to generally spell most of the words already. For example, if you don't don't how to spell the word friend, you may write it as 'fry end', it is correct, no, but teacher's won't correct the kid if he just starts using Phonics to do the spelling. The idea here is that kids learn from sound to spelling, it's OK you don't understand the meaning. On the other hand, in China, remebering words are mostly about connecting meaning and spelling. 

Based on Phonics, the way American remember spelling is very easy. catigrize words into different groups by pronoucation. Try to remebering a group together make it really easy to remeber the spelling. Go on to the Khan Kids App, open the libiary and Reading section. you can find a lof ways to group words. 

====

The first way is Phonics. For exmple, when you learn the letter A, you are told the pronoucation is A, then it is good time to learn Apple and Alligator together. there are aslo cases when different letter or letter combination has same pronouncation, e.g ir and or all have the same sound, so native kids learn the words like stir, shirt, singer together. 

Rhyming words is the second way to group words. Rhyming words are words that have the same ending sound. For example, the words ‘cat’, ‘hat’, and ‘rat’ all rhyme because they end with the same sound (-at). Rhyming words are often used in poetry and songwriting to create a musical or rhythmic effect. Thus they are also common learning materials for kids.



Compound words is the third way. suffix. like xxx-able xxx-ful xxx-less. this is another way to remeber in groups. Khan Kids has lessons to learn this. there are a list of 50 https://www.englishhints.com/list-of-suffixes.html . 

The fourth and final group is Sight Words. 

Going back to How I remeber spelling. I picked up a vocabulary book, rember the spelling like Phone numbers. in alpbet order. there are 3 main problems for this: NO.1 you don't learn the words in the context of reading, so even you know the meaning, you don't really know how to use it. on the other side, Phonics way don't really encouge you trying to remember the spelling of the word you don't use a lot. NO.2 words are not learned in groups, thus harder to remeber. NO.3, pronoucation was ignored completed sometimes, while on the opposite, in the Phonics way, pronoucation is the first class citizen, every new spelling you learn, it helps you remember the sound better.
