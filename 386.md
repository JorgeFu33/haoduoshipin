title: Why Reading Matters for English Learners?
---

- reading books is the only way you can 
  - use real English
    - interesting/rewarding enough that worth to form a habit
  - control the difficulty level
    - listening audios are not as easy to find and orginize
    - hard to find a real person to talk  

- real English is not for learners
  - adults always try to be concise and humorious
  - that makes them to use a lot words in a smarter way

- exams is root of all evil
  - it is common sense not to learn anything too hard from your current level
  - but to get high score in the coming exam, I had to remeber advanced words and expressions by rote. they are not part of you, and you forget everthing very quickly.

- learning in right order is KEY
  - should not use dictionary a lot
  - as a baby, nobody expect you speak real English
  - nobody expect you to be concise and hormorous 
  - so you have the chance to learn by right order
  - as a working adult you lost the oppernity when you communicating with anybody(speaking or writing), even yourself(with writing)
  - reading is the easiest way you can still have freedom to control the level and learn in order

- vocabulary books harmful
  - you learn too many difficult words that you can not use in your reading/writing/speaking
  - adult English is concise and humous, you can not learn from them
    - you need to learn in order, that is start from the basic meaning first
    - many words can be used in a very flexible way, which confusing learners. but if you pay attention, you know they all start from one baisc meaning you learn as a baby, when you are very fmailiar with the basic meaning, it's actully very natural to understand some derivative meanings. for example, for chinese studuents, you all hold a vocabularbook, and they lean 5 meaning of one word, some of the meanings seems not connected to each other at all, which making learningthe word super painful and hard. the solution? learning in right order, learn basic meaning and usecase of word first like a baby, then move to advanced usecases. Take the word, treat as a example, baby first known it as the word in 'trick and treat', you don't need to explin to baby what it means, baby will know it as candy. is that difficult, not at all. then only later, when people start to say 'my treat', given the context, it not hard to understand it at all. no explaination needed, just given the right context to learning. Thatâ€˜s how leveled reading works as way to learn new words, you don't need go to dictionry or vocabulary.
  - yeah, I am convinced that the right way to learn new words is through leveled books. not vocabulary book.
- roting does not work
  - the expressions you learn is too advanced 

- books are always there
  - when no one talks to you
  - 1million 1 level rule
