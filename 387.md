title: How to learn Phonics?

- don't start too early 
  - Children from Finland do exceptionally well in international reading tests, yet they don’t start school until they are 7 years old. A number of countries that don’t perform so well in these tests give formal reading lessons to 5-year-olds, so it’s been argued that early reading instruction does more harm than good.


- do not learn, acquire the language like a baby
  - Comprehensable Input is a MUST
  - Extensive Reading
  - Reading is the best way to get the inputs
  - three rules of natrual acquisition: 1. No mother tongue(it's not important and let's move on when stuck), 2. No grammer 3. No correction
  - Stephen Krashen: movies and comic books also works, being interesting
    - stories are good learning material

- be narrow
  - kids can pick whatever books he wants, but better to focus on certain areas

- when to learn grammer?
  - it's better NOT to learn grammer if you just want fluency in Enlgish
    - we have no time to think the structrue of a sentence and correct it before we blurt it out in a conversation. That's way grammer is a strange thing that can be learned, but not practiced.
    - if you do love grammer, learn it after you can speak.
      - grammers hurts your speaking https://youtu.be/illApgaLgGA?t=593

    - NO.1 "I would not have learned that word if I had not beening reading a book in English"
    - NO.2 "I looked up that word in a dictionary because it caught my attentiono" you don't have to check every word
    - NO.3 "The reason why I learned that word is because I brought that word back to the surface of my memory repeatly throughout the book"
  - only turn to dictionary when a word showed up multiple times

- everything start from the sounds/pronoucation
  - why lean KhanKids -- the -ck rule?
    - it is easy to remember since it is realted to the MagicE rule
    - it helps you to turn your pronoucation to spelling?
      - e.g /click/ since /i/ is short vowel, that's why you use 'ck' rather than 'ke'
      - becasue if you use 'ke', the sound of 'i' will be changed to long vowel
